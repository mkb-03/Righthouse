        question: "How often should gutters be cleaned?",
        answer: "Gutters should be cleaned at least twice annually - in spring and fall. Homes with overhanging trees may need cleaning 3-4 times per year. Regular cleaning prevents blockages, overflow, and water damage to your roof and foundation."

        question: "What are seamless gutters and why are they better?",
        answer: "Seamless gutters are custom-fabricated on-site to fit your home exactly, eliminating joints that can leak. They're more durable, require less maintenance, and provide better water flow. While initially more expensive, they last longer and prevent costly water damage."

        question: "Can gutters be repaired or do they need replacement?",
        answer: "Minor damage like small holes or loose brackets can often be repaired. However, extensive rust, multiple leaks, or severe damage usually requires replacement. We'll assess the condition and recommend the most cost-effective solution."

        question: "How do I know if my gutters are working properly?",
        answer: "Signs of properly working gutters include no overflow during rain, proper water flow through downpipes, no standing water, and no damage to fascia or soffits. If you notice overflow, leaks, or water damage, it's time for inspection and repair."
